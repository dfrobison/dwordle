# dWordle
My spin on the Wordle game using SwiftUI and the Composible Architecture. As with all things, this is meant as a learning exercise for me -- but having some fun in the process. It does have a dictionary of around 12K words and you can start a new game at any time. Also, each game is timed -- just to see how fast you can guess the word. Good inspiration for the main word grid from: https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/wordle-game-swiftui/
